# Disease Detection

This repo conisit of notebook deloped to Identify the disease "Monkeypox". 

Initial data had image data from 5 classes. They are normal skin, monkeypox, acne, cyct/tumor and Melonoma. The goal is to identify the Monkeypox disease from the input image of disease. 

To find out the disease from the inputed image deeplearning is used. Without building the model from scratch transfer learning techniques were used to save time and improved accuracy. Final model has a accuracy of 90%.

### Confusion matrix for model classification.

Final notebook containing all the codes is in the [Final_model](https://github.com/Vithyashagar/disease_detection/blob/main/Notebooks/Final_Model.ipynb) notebook.
Models will be updated periodically.

To Identify how the model identifies the disease classes saliency map was used. Salincy map related notbook can be found [here](https://github.com/Vithyashagar/disease_detection/blob/main/Notebooks/saliency.ipynb).
